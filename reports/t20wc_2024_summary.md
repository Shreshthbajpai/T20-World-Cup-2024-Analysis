Venues played a role in scoring patterns, influencing overall match totals.

## Next Steps
* Integrate ball-by-ball data for more granular analysis (e.g., death over performance, specific player matchups).
* Develop a predictive model for match outcomes based on team strengths and historical data.
* Create an interactive dashboard using tools like Streamlit or Power BI for dynamic exploration of the data.
